# hello-world
test repo for linux lab to practice working with GitHub through the terminal

I am a student at the University of Portland pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Business Analytics with a minor in Computer Science. In the coming years at UP, I hope to explore AI machine learning, predictive and prescriptive analytics, and operational systems.

The most fantastic, but confusing lab on revision control system I did this week!
